# Touching-Space-with-3D-Models

This is a projcet I was able to do with A&M's DEEP program. I have successfully shown the models in this project off at A&M's Physics Festival in 2022. These models can be downloaded and displayed anywhere. The goal of this project was to allow people who may have impaired vision a chance to explore space the way we all do!
