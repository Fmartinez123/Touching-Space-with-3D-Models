# Touching-Space-with-3D-Models

This is a projcet I was able to do with A&M's DEEP program. I have successfully shown the models in this project off at A&M's Physics Festival in 2022. These models can be downloaded and displayed anywhere. If you want to see how I made these models, you can run through `3D-Modeling-with-Python.ipynb` in the **Scripts** directory. The goal of this project was to allow people who may have impaired vision a chance to explore space the way we all do. 

You can watch a breif video I made on modeling the Eagle Nebula [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFF8yMLDjjk&feature=emb_logo).
